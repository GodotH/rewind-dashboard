# Changelog

## v1.7.0

### Added
- **Choose which terminal Launch opens**: the first time you click Launch, Rewind asks which terminal to use and lists only the ones actually installed on your machine, instead of picking one silently. Change it later from the gear icon next to Launch or from the Settings page. The choice is stored per platform, so a synced settings file does not let two machines overwrite each other's answer (#72)
- **Hide a single session**: hiding used to be a project-only action, so removing one noisy session meant hiding the whole folder it lived in. Sessions now have their own hide control on the session card and on the session detail page, independent of the project flag in both directions. The hidden banner counts sessions inside hidden projects separately from sessions hidden one by one, so the two no longer overlap (#71)

### Fixed
- **Launch opens PowerShell instead of Command Prompt on Windows**: resuming a session ran `claude --resume` under `cmd.exe`, which meant no PowerShell profile, no aliases and awkward quoting. Launch now writes a PowerShell script and hosts it under `pwsh.exe` when PowerShell 7 is installed, falling back to `powershell.exe` (#70)
- **Security: the launch endpoint accepted requests from any site**: `/api/launch-session` spawns `claude --resume --dangerously-skip-permissions`, and it previously acted on any POST that reached it, so any page open in your browser could drive it against a guessed session ID. The request's `Origin` is now checked against its own `Host` before the body is read, and the `Host` itself must be loopback, which also blocks DNS rebinding
- **Renamed sessions not findable by search**: four separate causes, fixed together. Hidden-project filtering ran before the search filter, so sessions inside a hidden project could not be reached by any query at all. The matcher was a raw substring check, so searching `vector crm` never matched `vector-crm-v2`. Session names were neither indexed nor shown on result cards, so the session you wanted could be on screen and unrecognizable. And cross-session ordering was pure recency, so a name match could fall past the 50-result limit
- **Search results reordered by how well the name matched**: the name-match ranking outranked the date comparison, so `Brain`, `brain-fix` and `hermes-brain` came back sorted by closeness of the name rather than by when you last used them. Name matches still come first, but within that group and within the rest, the most recent session wins

## v1.6.0

### Fixed
- **Sessions shown as "active" that were not**: liveness was inferred from the transcript file's modification time, but measured drift between that timestamp and the last real message reaches 174 days, and an external process touches these files hourly without appending anything. Liveness now comes from Claude Code's own process registry (`~/.claude/sessions/*.json`): a session is live only when its recorded process is actually running. A live-but-idle session reads as **waiting**, distinct from **working**, and no longer restarts a running timer
- **`/rename` names not showing, sessions labelled `agents-0a`**: the process registry only exists for sessions whose process is still alive, and it also carries auto-derived placeholder names. That whole name source is gone; the durable name is the transcript's own title entry, which survives process exit, reboot and folder moves. Session titles now resolve identically on the list and the detail page
- **First message missing from session titles**: messages with plain-text content were skipped entirely, and injected boilerplate turns were mistaken for the first real message
- **Search results in arbitrary order**: hits are now newest-first. Each session is represented by its most recent match, so the date and the snippet always describe the same message, and the result limit counts sessions rather than raw matches
- **Search failing silently**: every error collapsed into an empty result set, indistinguishable from "nothing matched". Failures are now visible, the index reports how far it has covered, and a rejected search no longer retries forever
- **Slow loads**: statistics re-parsed the entire 1 GB transcript corpus on every request. Per-session results are now cached against a fingerprint that includes subagent transcripts. The 3-second liveness poll no longer triggers a full scan of every session file
- **Projects duplicated after moving a folder**: a project is now identified by the working directory recorded in its transcripts rather than by a lossy encoding of its path. Projects whose folder no longer exists are flagged instead of disappearing, and their sessions stay listed and searchable
- **Launching a session from a folder that no longer exists**: previously spawned a terminal in a dead directory and failed silently; it now refuses with a clear message naming the missing path
- **Blank white panels**: empty results render a proper card explaining what happened and how to clear it, refreshing keeps the previous rows visible instead of blanking, and a stale saved filter no longer flashes "no matches" before correcting itself. An unset theme preference now resolves to dark
- **Test suite overwriting real data**: the end-to-end suite pointed the scanner at fixtures but left every cache path aimed at the real dashboard directory, so running it pruned the live search index down to three fixture sessions. All dashboard paths now honour the same environment override

### Note
On first launch this version re-reads every session once to rebuild its caches, which takes a few seconds. The conversation index rebuilds on the first search.

## v1.5.0

### Added
- **Real conversation search**: replaced the substring scan with a ranked SQLite FTS5 index (BM25 + snippets) that searches message text, tool calls, tool results, and thinking blocks, not just message text. Falls back to the simple scan when the native module is unavailable (#59)
- **Persistent filters**: sort, status, starred, view, and project filters now survive navigating away and back; explicit URL params still override (#60)
- **Hidden projects, surfaced**: the Sessions page shows a "N sessions in M projects hidden" banner with one-click unhide and a hidden-aware empty state, plus a **rescan** button to force a fresh scan when things look stale

### Fixed
- **Sessions silently missing**: project hide/pin is now keyed by the stable encoded directory name instead of a lossy decoded path, so new or path-colliding projects can no longer be auto-hidden; a one-time migration remaps legacy keys, drops orphaned keys and the `C:/` landmine, and resolves contradictory pinned+hidden state (#63)
- **Accidental whole-project hide**: the per-card "hide" button (which silently hid an entire project in one click) now reads as a project action and offers undo
- **Wrong counts**: message counts and token totals were extrapolated from 30 sampled lines; they are now exact via a single full pass, which also fixes the "most active" sort (#64)
- **Active detection**: no longer treats the persistent `subagents/` directory as a liveness lock (#29)
- **Render crashes**: hardened the production JSX build against an inherited `NODE_ENV=development` (`jsxDEV is not a function`), and removed a client-side `os.homedir()` crash that broke the Sessions page
- **Faster, un-stuck scans**: concurrent pollers now coalesce onto a single in-flight scan instead of overlapping cold scans
- **Tests no longer touch real data**: the disk-cache test sandboxes the cache directory instead of deleting `~/.claude-dashboard/cache`

## v1.4.0

### Added
- **One-click launch**: resuming a session now launches immediately (removed the confirmation popup)
- **Progressive session loading**: the first page renders fast and the next page is prefetched in the background; the session summary cache now persists to disk so cold starts stay quick even with thousands of sessions

### Fixed
- **Production build**: fixed the production SSR crash (`jsxDEV is not a function`); `npm run build` + `npm start` now serve correctly
- **Graceful missing sessions**: opening a deleted or rotated session shows a friendly "this session no longer exists" state instead of a raw error, and removes the stale card from the list
- **Terminal loader alignment**: the first-load loader is left-aligned with the rest of the page (no more centered "swing")
- **Hydration warning**: silenced the theme-script hydration mismatch and removed render-purity issues (`Date.now()` / refs during render)
- **macOS launch**: fixed Terminal escaping so session paths containing spaces work
- **Search placeholder**: the `⌘K` shortcut hint now renders correctly

### Internal
- E2E suite updated for the current dashboard navigation; unit + E2E suites green in CI

## v1.03

### Added
- **Dashboard overhaul**: 4-tab navigation (Dashboard, Sessions, Projects, Settings), unified stat box grid
- **Active session detection**: dual-strategy: lock directory (15min) + mtime-only (2min) for newer Claude Code versions
- **Conversation viewer**: full chat history on session detail page
- **Full-text conversation search**: searches inside all messages, shows matching snippets
- **Project badges**: clickable project labels on every session card
- **Launch confirmation popup**: shows session details before resuming
- **Matrix green theme**: emerald accents, loading animation, sidebar redesign

### Fixed
- **Path decoding**: Windows hyphens preserved, macOS homedir-matching heuristic for lossy encoding
- **Token counting**: fixed double-counting for sessions with < 30 lines (head/tail overlap)
- **Session launch**: reads `cwd` from JSONL data instead of lossy decoded path
- **Stream cleanup**: proper `try/finally` on readline streams to prevent resource leaks
- **Security**: UUID validation on sessionId, path traversal checks on cwd, removed `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

## v1.02

### Added
- **Renamable projects**: give projects meaningful names from the Projects page
- **Full-text search**: 3+ character queries search inside conversations
- **Search timestamps**: matching snippets show message timestamps
- **Collapsible agent sections**: tool call details collapse for readability

## v1.01

### Added
- **Sort modes**: latest, most messages, longest, largest, starred only
- **Grouped project view**: sessions under collapsible project headers
- **Projects route**: dedicated page for managing projects
- **Cross-platform launcher**: Windows, macOS (Terminal.app), Linux (gnome-terminal/konsole/xterm)

## v1.00

### Added
- Initial release, fork of claude-session-dashboard with session management, starring, renaming, and launching
