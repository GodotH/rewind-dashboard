# Rewind

**Your Claude Code sessions deserve better than `~/.claude/projects/`.**

A local dashboard for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) power users who've accumulated more sessions than they can remember. Browse, search, star, rename, and launch past sessions from a clean web UI. See what's actively running, what it cost you, and which project quietly consumed 3.2M tokens at 3am.

Everything runs locally. Nothing phones home. We don't even know how to spell "telemetry."

## Features

### Sessions: your command center

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Star** | Pin important sessions to the top. They earned it. |
| **Rename** | Give sessions real names. "chat-abc123" is not a personality. |
| **Launch** | One click to resume any session in your terminal, in the terminal app you picked. |
| **Active detection** | See which sessions are running right now (comforting green glow included). |
| **Sort** | By latest, most messages, longest, largest, or starred only. |
| **Hide** | Drop one noisy session out of the list from the `...` menu, without hiding its project. |
| **Copy resume** | `claude --resume <id>` to clipboard from the `...` menu. |

### Search: find that one session from last Tuesday

- **`Cmd+K`** / **`Ctrl+K`**: muscle memory, we got you
- **Full-text conversation search**: not just titles, but what was actually said
- **Session names are searchable**: the name you gave a session is indexed and shown on result cards, and punctuation does not matter: `vector crm` finds `vector-crm-v2`
- **Hidden things still turn up**: a query searches everything, including sessions you hid and sessions inside hidden projects. Those results are tagged `hidden project` or `hidden session` and counted in a line under the search box, so hiding never makes something unfindable
- **Ordering**: name matches first, then everything else, most recent first within each group
- **Project filter**: dropdown or click a project badge on any card

### Projects: tame the chaos

- **Rename, star, or hide** projects from the dedicated Projects page
- **Project badges**: clickable labels on every session card
- **Starred project surfacing**: latest session from your starred projects floats to the top of the dashboard

### Hiding: one session, or the whole project

Two independent switches. Hiding a project never hides its sessions individually, and unhiding a project never un-hides a session you hid by hand.

| You want to hide | Where | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| One session | `...` menu on the card, or the **Hide** button on the session detail page | That session leaves the list. Its project and every other session in it are untouched. |
| A whole project | The eye button on a session card, or the Projects page | Every session in that project leaves the list. |

The banner at the top of the Sessions page counts the two separately (`N sessions in M hidden projects` and `N sessions hidden one by one`) so nothing is double-counted, and both have one-click unhide.

### Choosing your terminal

The first time you click **Launch** with no saved preference, Rewind asks which terminal to use and lists only the terminals it actually found on your machine. It never picks one for you silently.

- Change it later from the **gear icon** next to any Launch button, or from the **Settings** page
- **Automatic** is a valid answer: Rewind picks the best installed option each time
- Your answer is saved per platform in `~/.claude-dashboard/settings.json`, so syncing that file between a Mac and a PC does not make them fight over it
- If the terminal you chose is later uninstalled, Launch still works and tells you it fell back

| Platform | Options detected |
|---|---|
| Windows | Windows Terminal (PowerShell 7 or Windows PowerShell), PowerShell 7, Windows PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash |
| macOS | Terminal, iTerm2, Ghostty, Alacritty |
| Linux | GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Xfce Terminal, xterm, or your `x-terminal-emulator` default |

### Dashboard & Stats: know your usage

- **At-a-glance metrics**: sessions, messages, tokens, estimated cost
- **Activity heatmap**: like GitHub's contribution graph, but for your AI conversations
- **Token usage over time**: daily or weekly, broken down by model
- **Hourly distribution**: discover that you apparently code at 2am more than you thought

### Conversation Viewer

Full chat history on the session detail page, every message, tool call, and timestamp. For when you need to figure out what you asked Claude to do before your morning coffee.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mr-godot/rewind-dashboard.git
cd rewind-dashboard/apps/web
npm install
npx vite --port 3030
```

Open **http://localhost:3030**. That's it.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**: install instructions per OS below
- **Claude Code** installed, Rewind reads session data from `~/.claude/projects/`
- At least one Claude Code session (go talk to Claude, we'll wait)

<details>
<summary><b>Install Node.js, Windows</b></summary>

```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

Or grab the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Then run the four Quick Start commands above in **PowerShell** or **Windows Terminal**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install Node.js, macOS</b></summary>

```bash
brew install node
```

Or download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Then run the four Quick Start commands above.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install Node.js, Linux</b></summary>

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

# …or via nvm (recommended for an up-to-date version)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install --lts
```

Then run the four Quick Start commands above.

> Linux is fully supported (the app is pure Node + browser) but less battle-tested than Windows and macOS, bug reports welcome. The in-terminal **Launch** button asks you once which terminal to use, offering whichever of `x-terminal-emulator`, `gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, `xfce4-terminal` and `xterm` it finds.
</details>

### Your first 30 seconds

1. **Browse**: sessions appear on the Dashboard, sorted by most recent
2. **Star**: click ★ to pin a session to the top
3. **Rename**: click `...` → Rename (you'll thank yourself later)
4. **Search**: `Cmd+K` to find anything across all sessions
5. **Launch**: green button resumes any session in your terminal; the first click asks which terminal you want
6. **Hide**: `...` → Hide session drops one session from the list; the eye button hides its whole project
7. **Projects**: sidebar link to organize, star, and hide projects

## How It Works

Claude Code stores sessions as JSONL files under `~/.claude/projects/`. Rewind scans them on a timer and presents a proper UI:

- **Sessions**: parsed from JSONL: timestamps, messages, tokens, tool calls, models
- **Active detection**: dual-strategy: lock directory check (15min threshold) + file modification time (2min) for newer Claude Code versions
- **Metadata**: your pins, renames, and hidden sessions and projects live in `~/.claude-dashboard/session-metadata.json`; your terminal choice lives in `~/.claude-dashboard/settings.json`
- **Launch**: writes a short throwaway script to your temp directory and opens it in the terminal you chose (a `.ps1` under PowerShell on Windows, a shell script elsewhere), then deletes it. The window is titled `Rewind Session <id-prefix>` where the terminal supports it.
- **Launch endpoint**: `/api/launch-session` only accepts same-origin POSTs from a loopback host, so another site open in your browser cannot use it to start a session.

Zero network requests. Your sessions stay on your machine.

Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.Run "cmd /c cd /d ""C:\path\to\rewind-dashboard\apps\web"" && npx vite --port 3030", 0, False
```

Register as a scheduled task:

```powershell
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "wscript.exe" -Argument '"C:\path\to\start-rewind.vbs"'
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogOn
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "RewindDashboard" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger

## Mobile Access (Experimental)

Rewind is a web app, any browser works. Start with `npx vite --port 3030 --host 0.0.0.0`, then open `http://<your-ip>:3030` from your phone. Add to Home Screen for an app-like experience.

For remote access: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) or [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) work great.

> The Launch button won't work from mobile (no terminal). Everything else does.

## Troubleshooting

### "What is this terminal window?"

When you click **Launch**, Rewind opens a new terminal window running `claude --resume`. On Windows, this window is titled **`Rewind Session <id-prefix>`** (where `<id-prefix>` is the first 8 characters of the session UUID) so you can confirm it came from Rewind. You can close these windows at any time, closing the terminal ends that Claude session but does not affect the dashboard or other sessions.

### "Rewind is asking me to pick a terminal"

That prompt appears once, on your first Launch, and only because Rewind refuses to guess. Pick anything, including **Automatic**. Change it later from the gear icon next to Launch or from Settings. If the dialog lists fewer terminals than you expected, Rewind only shows what it could detect on this machine.

### Orphan terminals from older versions

Versions of Rewind prior to v1.7.0 hosted sessions under `cmd.exe` and could occasionally leave unlabeled console windows behind after a Claude session ended or the Vite dev server was killed. If you see unfamiliar console windows on your desktop with no obvious title, they are almost certainly harmless orphans from a previous session, just close them, or kill them via PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-Process cmd | Where-Object { $_.MainWindowTitle -eq '' } | Stop-Process
```

New launches (with the titled-window fix) no longer produce these orphans, and the temporary `.bat` files they spawn self-delete when the terminal exits.

> **Note**: Both dev mode (`npx vite --port 3030`) and the production build (`npm run build` then `npm start`) work. The in-app **Launch session** button only works in dev mode, since its endpoint runs as Vite dev-server middleware.
